 .true.						!.true. for variable, single layer analysis, .false. for multiple layer analysis using uniform soil properties within each layer

 256 256 128	  	  			!number of x,y,z elements in original generated soil (must fit a*2^b)
 90  90  40					!x,y,z dimensions of site (m)
 3						! 1. Generate individual soils in each MC realisation. 2. pre-generate soils and store in memory (Should use one very large soil in single layer mode) 3. Same as 2 but try and read in single layer soil from disk if available.
 4						!The upscale factor for single layer soils. Recommend 5.
 dlavx3	dlavx2					!correlation function for 3D and 2D LAS
 0.5						!size of elements (cube length)
 4096,	6					!limit for stage 0 matrix size, where this value is k1*k2*k3, max no. subdivisions
 -1 -1						!Lower and upper range of MC realisations to export soils for. 1st value -ve doesn't export. 2nd value -ve exits after exporting.
 !Single layer soil options

 0							!SD mode. 0=no variability, 1=variability across MC realisations, 2=2D RF for variability,3=2+1D RF for boreholes.
 .false.						!ignore depths and properties of each layer, and instead read in explicit borehole depths from other file
 .true.						!enforce fixed layer depths at boreholes despite added randomness, if the above option is set to true
