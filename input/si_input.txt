 !Site investigation information
 41,41		!initial borehole x,y offset from corner of soil in elements (ideally coincides with building plan). This is ignored with the EA.
 100,100		!dimensions of site investigation area in elements. This is ignored with the EA.
 2,2		!borehole step size in each dimension for the heat map mode
 6		!No. test types (leave at 6)
 .true.		!use confidence interval to truncate unrealistic sample values (recommended, especially if used with 'add_errors' option.
 2.576		!confidence interval z score for the above truncation, recommend 99% (2.576)
 .false.		!'add_errors' - add random errors to tested samples (highly recommended for realistic sampling)
 !Below are test stats: Transformation error, bias error, measurement error, sampling frequency (elements), cost per metre.
 0 , 0 , 0,         3,  120, dct			!discrete testing, no errors
 0 , 0 , 0,         1,  77,  cts			!continuous testing, no errors

 1,0.25		!standard deviations below the mean in the Geometric 'SD' reduction method. Percentile to use for the percentile reduction method. Recommend 1 and 0.25 currently.
 !note: the following information is only relevant is read_si is set to false, in which case the investigations to assess are built using all combinations of the below parameters.
 2		!read_si parameter. 1 = Generate investigations from the below variables. 2 = read investigation configurations from 'input/si.txt' data. 3 = also read tests and depths on a per-borehole basis.
 5		!Number of borehole cases to investigate	Note: These 4 lines correspond to the 4 lines below them.
 1		!Number of tests to investigate
 1		!Number of reduction methods to investigate
 1		!Number of borehole depth cases to analyse
 1,4,9,16,25
